			<h2>MY TIME AT KURANUI</h2>
			<p>
				I’ve been at this school for 6 months now or 2 full terms. In that time I learned new skills and became friends with new
				people really fast. Kuranui College offered me a large number of new subjects, that I wouldn't be able to experience
				in Germany. For example Digital Media or Computer Science and I found that I really enjoy those subjects. All the teachers
				at this school are very kind and helpful. You really notice that they want you to pass and achieve your goals. The big
				variety of subjects here is very good and you learn to express yourself and quickly find things you really enjoy doing,
				maybe even learn new things that you have never done before. As an international student at Kuranui College, you get
				many opportunities to see New Zealand and meet new people around the world in their ‘International Club’. There is a
				big variety of students at this College, which makes it very easy to find people that you can relate to and be friends
				with. For me it took only a day to make new friends, since I joined the friend group of my host brother. Kuranui College
				is a school full of kind people that make your time here the best it could be.

			<h2>THINGS I HAVE LEARNED</h2>
			<p>
				During my time here I have learned a few things, or noticed differences between German and New Zealand. The first couple
				of things I want to talk about is school. At Kuranui you need to wear a uniform and your typical school day ends at 3:15p,
				where in Germany we wear whatever we want everyday and come home after 12:55pm. I like the concept of a uniform, since
				you always know what you wear, but sometimes I miss being home before one o’clock. Another difference is that New Zealand
				schools really focus on sports at school. You can choose to do over 10 different sports here. In Germany we don’t have
				that. We don’t have sport-teams, which you can join and practice or play games with. I improved my cooking and baking
				skills here. I found that I really enjoy doing that and I am interested in improving them even further. I also began
				to code, which I was always too lazy to learn. Now that I am in New Zealand I find new things to do and new things I
				enjoy, which I probably wouldn’t have found in Germany.
